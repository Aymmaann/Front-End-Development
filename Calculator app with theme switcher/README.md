## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I Learned
During the development of my project, I have integrated several key functionalities using JavaScript and enhanced the user interface with CSS variables. Here are some key elements of the implementation:

- **Calculator Logic**: Developed essential calculator functionalities including resetting the calculator state, deleting the last entered character, checking for decimal input, and performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with error handling for display length.

- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Implemented dynamic theme switching functionality using JavaScript and CSS variables. Based on the selected theme, adjusted background colors, text colors, and hover effects across the calculator interface.


### Continued Development
Moving forward, I plan to further optimize the user experience by refining UI interactions, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and potentially integrating additional features such as history tracking or advanced mathematical operations.
