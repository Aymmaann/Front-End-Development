## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build an interactive pricing component where users can view different pricing options based on their selection of monthly or yearly billing. The component should also dynamically update based on the slider input for page views.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to:

- Implement dynamic updates based on user interactions (slider input and toggle).
- Utilize media queries effectively for responsive design, adapting layouts for different screen sizes.
- Manage state in JavaScript to toggle between monthly and yearly billing options.
- Enhance accessibility by ensuring proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML structure.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving my CSS skills, particularly in managing complex layouts and animations.
- Exploring frontend frameworks like React.js to streamline development and manage state more efficiently.
- Deepening my understanding of accessibility practices and implementing ARIA roles for better usability.
