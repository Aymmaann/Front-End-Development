## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to structure a blog preview card using semantic HTML elements and apply responsive design principles using CSS flexbox. Additionally, I gained experience in managing hover and focus states for interactive elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my CSS skills, particularly in areas like CSS Grid and animation effects. I also plan to explore JavaScript to add interactivity to my web projects.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is my go-to resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. It provides clear explanations and examples for various web development topics.
