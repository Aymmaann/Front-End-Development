## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into several key areas:

- **Responsive Design:** Implemented a mobile-first approach using media queries to ensure compatibility across various devices.

- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Managed mobile navigation toggle functionality using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.

-- **Interactivity**: Enhanced interactivity through JavaScript by manipulating the DOM to dynamically update content and respond to user actions.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to refine my skills in handling complex data interactions more efficiently. I also plan to explore advanced CSS techniques to further enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of web applications. Additionally, I intend to deepen my understanding of accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity in all my projects.
