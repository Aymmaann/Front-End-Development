## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to structure a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, I deepened my understanding of:

- Utilizing CSS custom properties (variables) to manage colors and styles consistently throughout the app.
- Implementing asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from an API and update the DOM dynamically.
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure the app looks good on all devices.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on the following areas to further enhance my skills:

- **Improving CSS organization:** Exploring methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier) for more scalable CSS architecture.
- **Enhancing JavaScript proficiency:** Practicing more complex JavaScript functionalities and exploring modern frameworks/libraries for larger-scale applications.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the application is fully accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
