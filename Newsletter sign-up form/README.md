## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement form validation using JavaScript. I also improved my skills in responsive design by using media queries to adjust the layout based on different screen sizes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my understanding of responsive design techniques, particularly in handling complex layouts and optimizing performance for various devices. Additionally, I plan to delve deeper into JavaScript and explore frameworks like React to build more interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Improving my knowledge of accessibility best practices and implementing them consistently across projects is also a priority. Overall, I'm committed to continuous learning and refining my skills to create better user experiences and maintain high coding standards.
