## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this project, I learned the importance of semantic HTML markup for better structure and accessibility. CSS custom properties proved invaluable for maintaining consistent styling and enabling easy updates. Flexbox and Grid layouts were instrumental in achieving responsive designs adaptable to various screen sizes. Background images were effectively utilized to enhance visual appeal, while media queries ensured a seamless user experience across devices. Overall, this project provided valuable insights into creating well-structured, responsive web designs.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on improving my CSS skills, especially in the areas of layout and responsiveness.
