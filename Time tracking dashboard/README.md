## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive design, JavaScript event handling, and data manipulation. I gained practical experience in creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, responding to user interactions dynamically, and updating content based on fetched data.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I aim to further enhance my skills in CSS animations and transitions to create smoother and more polished user experiences. Additionally, I plan to explore more advanced JavaScript techniques, such as using ES6 features and modularizing code for better maintainability. This project has inspired me to delve deeper into frontend development and continue refining my abilities.
