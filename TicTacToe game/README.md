## Description
Retro TicTacToe is a web-based game that allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe. The game features a nostalgic retro gaming design and simple gameplay. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (either "X" or "O").

## Usage
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Players can click on the empty squares in the grid to place their symbol. The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
