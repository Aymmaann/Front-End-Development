## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive layout using CSS flexbox and media queries. I also improved my JavaScript skills by implementing form validation functionality.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further explore advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid and animations. I also plan to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by learning more about ES6 features and modern frameworks like React.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/): This website provides comprehensive documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's my go-to resource whenever I need to look up a language feature or API.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges): Frontend Mentor offers a variety of coding challenges that are perfect for honing your skills. Their projects come with design mockups and detailed requirements, making them great practice for real-world web development.
