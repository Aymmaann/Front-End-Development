## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive layout using flexbox and media queries. I also gained more experience in styling elements with CSS and using CSS custom properties to define reusable variables.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further explore advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid and animations. I also plan to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by learning more about ES6 features and modern frameworks like React.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use flexbox for layout.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - MDN is always a great resource for learning web development concepts and finding detailed documentation on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
