## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different color from the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the provided JSON data file to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API for data retrieval

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS for layout and styling, especially with regards to flexbox for responsive design. Implementing dynamic data binding using JavaScript taught me how to manage and update content dynamically based on user interactions and data changes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to enhance my skills in handling asynchronous JavaScript operations more efficiently, such as error handling and data parsing. Additionally, exploring more advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid for layout and CSS animations for interactive elements is on my learning roadmap.
